* As a user, I want signup and receive a confirmation email, so that I can access the site.

* As a host user, I want to add a listing, so that I can allow others to view and search my home/apt listing.

* As a host user, I want to add photo to my profile, so that other users know I am a person.

* As a host user, I want to add photos of my listing, so that others have a good idea of what my place looks like.

* As a host user, I want to add multiple listings at once by uploading a CSV file, so that I save time.
