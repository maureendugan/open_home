Open Home (Airbnb Clone)
==================
Maureen Dugan & Natalie Blackburn

We are practicing using devise, paperclip, and ActionMailer

* As a user, I want signup and receive a confirmation email, so that I can access the site.

* As a host user, I want to add a listing, so that I can allow others to view and search my home/apt listing.

* As a host user, I want to add photos of my listing, so that others have a good idea of what my place looks like.

* I want a static homepage for anyone who visits the site, so that they can see our content and get inspired to sign up.
